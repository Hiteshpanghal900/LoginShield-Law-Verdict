Create a mini web app FastAPI(backend) + NextJS(frontend) + Auth0 with N device functionality. 
N device functionality - Only N devices are allowed to login concurrently with the same account. For example if we configure N=3, then using a particular account a user can be logged in at atmost 3 devices at a time. 

The moment user logs in using N+1 device they should be prompted to either cancel login or force log out one of the previous logged in devices using the current device. 

The logged out device(when it comes back on the website) should have a graceful logout informing them that they were logged out.
The private page needs to display Full Name of the user along with their phone number. 

The frontend should have a very polished and professional look.
